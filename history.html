      <p class="lead"><strong>Civilisational</strong> history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia, to the
        Chalcolithic. The country's early documented
        history featured successions of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires, vying for regional dominance.

        Islam arrived during the 6th-7th century AD and became dominant gradually since the early 13th century with the
        conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji as well as activities of Sunni missionaries such as Shah Jalal in the region.
        Later,
        Muslim rulers initiated the preaching of Islam by building mosques. From the 14th century onward, it was ruled
        by the
        Bengal Sultanate, founded by king Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, beginning a period of the country's economic prosperity
        and
        military dominance over the regional empires, which was referred by the Europeans to as the richest country to
        trade
        with.[1] Afterwards, the region came under the Mughal Empire, as its wealthiest province. Bengal Subah generated
        almost
        half of the empire's GDP and 12% of the world's GDP,[2][3][4] larger than the entirety of western Europe,
        ushering in
        the period of proto-industrialization.[5] The population of the capital city, Dhaka, exceeded a million people.

        Following the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, Bengal became a semi-independent state under the
        Nawabs
        of Bengal, ultimately led by Siraj ud-Daulah. It was later conquered by the British East India Company at the
        Battle of
        Plassey in 1757. Bengal directly contributed to the Industrial Revolution in Britain but led to its
        deindustrialization.[6][7][8][9] The Bengal Presidency was later established.

        The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the separation of Bengal and India in August 1947, when
        the
        region became East Pakistan as a part of the newly formed State of Pakistan following the end of British rule in
        the
        region.[10] Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence in March 1971 led to the nine-month long Bangladesh
        Liberation War,
        that culminated with East Pakistan emerging as the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

        After independence, the new state endured famine, natural disasters, and widespread poverty, as well as
        political
        turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and rapid
        economic
        progress.

      <p class="lead">Muslim rule in the region was inaugurated with the taking of Nadia in 1202. Initially, Bengal was
        administered by the
        Delhi Sultanate's governors, then by independent sultanates and then was under the rule of the Mughal empire.
        While
        Muslims had advanced into Sindh in the 700s, it was in Afghanistan that the ultimate Muslim conquest of South
        Asia
        originated from, starting with the raids by Mahmud of Ghazni in the early 11th century. The Afghanistan-based
        Ghurids
        replaced the Ghaznavids and they started expanded into the Ganges region. As part of this eastward expansion
        Ikhtiyaruddin Muhammad Bakhtiar Khan defeated the Palas in Bihar and in 1202 was victorious over the Senas in
        Nadia. In
        1206 the Delhi Sultanate was created. It was not a true dynasty but the rulers was known as Mamluk. The
        Sultanate
        continued till 1290. The conquest of Nadia did not entail swift conversions to Islam. The authority of the Senas
        persisted in Vikrampur till 1245 and a large part of eastern Bangladesh had neither been conquered nor
        converted.[44]

        Four dynasties based in Delhi succeeded the Slave dynasty. The Khaljis ruled from 1290 to 1320. The Tughluq
        dynasty's
        rule lasted until 1413. Sayyid rule ran from 1414 to 1451. The Lodhi dynasty ruled in the 1451-1526 period. But
        the writ
        of the Delhi Sultanate had been weak in its outer regions and Bengal like other similar areas turned into an
        independent
        region. Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah became the ruler of independent Bengal in 1342 and his dynasty ruled until
        1486,
        barring a short interlude.

        Babar defeated the Lodhis at Panipat in 1526 and the Mughals established India's greatest state since the time
        of the
        Mauryas. But during Sheh Shah Suri's rebellion against the second Mughal ruler Humayan, he triumphed over the
        Hussain
        Shahi dynasty's Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah in 1538, thus bringing an end to the independent status of Bengal.
        For a
        short time Humayun ruled Gaur.

        Bengal along with other parts of eastern India was ruled by Sheh Shah Suri. He implemented many reforms such as
        introducing parganas. These were land survey based local tax units. He is most famous for designing the Grand
        Trunk Road
        between Calcutta and Punjab. Humayun retook Delhi in 1556. But the Suris continued ruling Bengal until 1564
        when
        they were replaced by the Karrani dynasty. Like the Suris, they were not native to Bengal. They had been raiders
        whom
        the Mughal armies had driven eastwards.

        In the early hours of 26 March 1971, a military crackdown by the Pakistan army began. The Bangabandhu Sheikh
        Mujibur
        Rahman was arrested and the political leaders dispersed, mostly fleeing to neighbouring India where they
        organised a
        provisional government. Before being arrested by the Pakistani Army, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman passed a hand written
        note
        which contained the Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence. This note was widely circulated and transmitted by
        the then
        East Pakistan Rifles' wireless transmitter. The world press reports from late March 1971 also make sure that
        Bangladesh's declaration of independence by Bangabandhu was widely reported throughout the world. Bengali Army
        officer
        Major Ziaur Rahman captured the Kalurghat Radio Station in Chittagong and read the declaration of independence
        of Bangladesh during the evening hours on 27 March.

        This is Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra. I, Major Ziaur Rahman, at the direction of Bangobondhu Mujibur Rahman,
        hereby
        declare that the Independent People's Republic of Bangladesh has been established. At his direction, I have
        taken
        command as the temporary Head of the Republic. In the name of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, I call upon all Bengalees
        to rise
        against the attack by the West Pakistani Army. We shall fight to the last to free our motherland. Victory is, by
        the
        Grace of Allah, ours. Joy Bangla.

        The Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh was formed on 10 April in Meherpur (later
        renamed as
        Mujibnagar, a town adjacent to the Indian border). Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was announced to be the Head of the
        State.
        Tajuddin Ahmed became the Prime Minister, Syed Nazrul Islam became the acting president and Khondaker Mostaq
        Ahmed the
        Foreign Minister. There the war plan was sketched out with Bangladesh armed forces established and named
        "Muktifoujo".
        Later these forces were named "Muktibahini" (freedom fighters). M. A. G. Osmani was appointed as the Chief of
        the Armed
        Forces.

        For military purposes, Bangladesh was divided into 11 sectors under 11 sector commanders. In addition to these
        sectors,
        later in the war, three special forces were formed: Z Force, S Force and K Force. These three forces' names were
        derived
        from the initial letters of the commander's name. The training and most of the arms and ammunitions were
        arranged by the
        Meherpur government which was supported by India. As fighting grew between the Pakistan Army and the Bengali
        Mukti
        Bahini, an estimated ten million Bengalis, mainly Hindus, sought refuge in the Indian states of Assam, Tripura
        and West
        Bengal.

        The freedom fighters were not able to beat the military. The Pakistani military created civilian and
        paramilitary
        groups to neutralise the freedom fighters. They recruited Biharis and Bengalis who did not support the
        separation
        of East Pakistan.

        When it became clear that neither the Pakistani military nor the freedom fighters could win, India gradually
        started its
        invasion. It increased its efforts at the international level and increased its military activities in East
        Pakistan but did not declare war out of fear of the geopolitical aftermath. India had its opportunity to declare
        war
        when Pakistan attacked Indian airfields on 3 December. The Indian military and Mukti Bahini had the edge with
        better
        weaponry, complete air and naval supremacy and support from most locals. The Pakistani army killed and raped
        many
        Bengalis. Pro-Pakistan militias killed Bengali intellectuals near the war's end. Pakistan's administration
        collapsed and
        the army surrendered on 16 December.
