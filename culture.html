      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="lead">Bangladesh has a rich, diverse culture. Its deeply rooted heritage is thoroughly reflected in its
        architecture, dance,
        literature, music, painting and clothing. The three primary religions of Bangladesh (Hinduism, Buddhism and
        Islam) have
        had a great influence on its culture and history.The people of Bangladesh have a rich fictional legacy, with the
        first available form of literature being over a thousand
        years old. Bengali literature developed considerably during the medieval period with the rise of popular poets
        such as
        Chandi Das, Daulat Kazi an Alaol.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">The traditional music of Bangladesh is very much the same as that of the Indian sub-continent. The
        music in Bangladesh
        can be divided into three main categories: classical, modern and folk. Both vocal and instrumental classical
        music is
        enjoyed in Bangladesh. Ustad Ayet Ali Khan and Ustad Alauddin are two famous classical instrumental players that
        are
        internationally known. Modern music is becoming more popular and is practiced widely. Contemporary, pop songs
        and bands
        are also enjoying more widespread fame, but are mainly popular in the regions of Dhaka City.</p>

      <h2>Eid <small>(Most Happiest Day for Muslims)</small> </h2>


      <p class="lead">Eid-ul Fitr is one of the two main Muslim religious festivals in Bangladesh. Eid and fitr are
        Arabic words. Eid means
        festival and fitr means to open, to break fasting, and to go back to normal situation. Eid-ul Fitr is the day of
        joy on
        the 1st of the month of Shawwal, when people return to the normal routine of life after completing the siam
        (restraint)
        and fasting in the holy month of Ramadan. The month of Siam begins after the appearance of the new moon of the
        month of
        holy Ramadan and roza (fasting) closes on sighting the new moon of the next month of Shawwal. During this month
        Muslims
        keep anger, sex, senses and emotions, illusions and jealousy under restraint. For this reason, the word fitr is
        used in
        the sense of victory also.
        Bangladesh is place of racial harmony and people of different religions lives here with peace and harmony.
        Perhaps
        Bangladesh is the only country of the world where every religion's festival days are celebrated as government
        holidays.
        The government declares holiday for three days on the occasion. Educational institutions usually remain closed
        during
        this time. Different newspapers publish articles on the life and philosophy of Hazrat Muhammad (Sm), the
        significance of
        Eid, and the ideals of Islam. The radio and television broadcast special programmes.
      </p>
      <img src="img/culture/eid1.jpg" alt="Eid" class="img-fluid rounded py-4">
      <p class="lead">One week before the Eid festival people start going to their respective hometowns and villages
        from Dhaka to to meet
        relatives and celebrate the festival together. Quiet remote villages become crowded. Everyone goes to meet each
        other in
        the village. The roads become overcrowded and as a result some accidents usually occur this time.
        Preparation of Eid starts long before the Eid. People go shopping for Eid dress. For men, Punjabi is the special
        dress
        for Eid. Women prefer to wear saree and Salwar-Kamiz. During Eid shopping, people purchase for themselves, and
        for
        family members and relatives as much as possible. Giving Eid present is a long tradition of Bangladesh. Nowadays
        exchange of Eid cards has come in vogue.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Eid-ul Fitr is celebrated in Bangladesh with great éclat. Bangladeshi observes the holiday by performing the
        obligatory
        Eid prayers on the morning of Eid, giving Zakat ul Fitr. Congregational prayers are held in all rural and urban
        places.
        In Dhaka, the Eid congregations are held at the national Eidgah, all major mosques including the Baitul
        Mukarram. The
        biggest congregation of the country is held at Sholakia in Kishoreganj, where about half a million people join
        the Eid
        prayer.
        Eid day starts in the very morning by men’s and kid’s taking shower and getting ready wearing new Punjabi, and
        go to the
        Eid-gah (a special place to do eid prayer). Muslims perform two rakats of Eid Namaz on the day whicj lasts for
        at least
        one hour. They exchange Salam and greetings by embracing one another irrespective of status or age. This is the
        sweetest
        moment of the eid. This hugging going on the whole day when meet someone new. Children purchase balloon and
        other toys
        from Eid-gah. They also visit the graves of the relatives and pious Muslims. Food and clothes are distributed to
        the
        poor. Popular customs also include ladies decorating one's hands with henna, dressing up in new clothes and
        having a
        good meal with family and friends.

      <h2>Pohela Boisakh <small>(New Year for Bengali)</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Pahela Baishakh (Bengali: পহেলা বৈশাখ, romanized: Pohela Boishakh) or Bangla Noboborsho (Bengali: বাংলা নববর্ষ)
        is the
        first day of Bengali Calendar. It is celebrated on 14 April as a national holiday in Bangladesh, and on 14 or 15
        April
        in the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Northern Odisha and parts of Assam by people of Bengali
        heritage,
        irrespective of their religious faith.

        Celebration of Pahela Baishakh traces its roots during the Mughal rule in the region with the proclamation of
        tax
        collection reforms by Emperor Akbar. The festival date is set according to the lunisolar Bengali calendar as the
        first
        day of its first month Boishakh. It therefore almost always falls on or about 14 April every year on the
        Gregorian
        calendar. The same day is observed elsewhere as the traditional solar new year and a harvest festival, and is
        known
        by other names such as Vaisakhi in central and north India, Ugadi in South India Vishu in Kerala and Puthandu in
        Tamil
        Nadu. The festival is celebrated with processions, fairs and family time. The traditional greeting for Bengali
        New
        Year is শুভ নববর্ষ "Shubho Noboborsho" which is literally "Happy New Year". The festive Mangal Shobhajatra is
        organized
        in Bangladesh. In 2016, the UNESCO declared this festivity organized by the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of
        Dhaka as
        a cultural heritage of humanity.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The Bengali New Year is observed as a public holiday in Bangladesh. It is celebrated across religious boundaries
        by its
        Muslim majority and Hindu minority. According to Willem van Schendel and Henk Schulte Nordholt, the festival
        became
        a popular means of expressing cultural pride and heritage among the Bangladeshi as they resisted Pakistani rule
        in the
        1950s and 1960s.

        The day is marked with singing, processions, and fairs. Traditionally, businesses start this day with a new
        ledger,
        clearing out the old. Singers perform traditional songs welcoming the new year. People enjoy classical jatra
        plays.
        People wear festive dress with women desking their hair with flowers. White-red color combinations are
        particularly
        popular.

        Bangladeshis prepare and enjoy a variety of traditional festive foods on Pohela Boishakh. These include panta
        bhat
        (watered rice), ilish bhaji (fried hilsa fish) and many special bhartas (pastes).
      </p>
      <img src="img/culture/boisakh.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid rounded py-4">
      <p class="lead">
        The celebrations start in Dhaka at dawn with a rendition of Rabindranath Tagore's song "Esho he Boishakh" by
        Chhayanaut
        under the banyan tree at Ramna (the Ramna Batamul). An integral part of the festivities is the Mangal
        Shobhajatra, a
        traditional colourful procession organised by the students of the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka
        (Charukala).
        According to the history, the rudimentary step of Mangal Shobhjatra was started in Jessore by Charupith, a
        community
        organization, in 1985. Later in 1989 the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka arranged this Mangal
        Shobhajatra with
        different motives and themes. Now, the Mangal Shobhajatra is celebrated by different organization in all over
        the
        country.

        The Dhaka University Mangal Shobhajatra tradition started in 1989 when students used the procession to overcome
        their
        frustration with the military rule. They organized the festival to create masks and floats with at least three
        theme,
        one highlighting evil, another courage, and a third about peace. It also highlighted the pride of Bangladeshi
        people
        for their folk heritage irrespective of religion, creed, caste, gender or age.

        In recent years, the procession has a different theme relevant to the country's culture and politics every year.
        Different cultural organizations and bands also perform on this occasion and fairs celebrating Bengali culture
        are
        organized throughout the country. Other traditional events held to celebrate Pohela Boishakh include bull racing
        in
        Munshiganj, wrestling in Chittagong, boat racing, cockfights, pigeon racing.

      <h2>Weeding <small>(Most Decorative Culture Of Bangladesh)</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Bengali weddings are traditionally in five parts: first, it is the bride and groom's Mehendi Shondha (also
        called Pan
        Chini), the bride's Gaye Holud, the groom's Gaye Holud, the Biye, and the Bou Bhaat. These often take place on
        separate
        days. The first event in a wedding is an informal one: the groom presents the bride with a ring marking the
        "engagement"
        which is gaining popularity. For the mehendi shondha the bride's side apply henna to each other as well as the
        bride for
        the bride's Gaye Holud, the groom's family – except the groom himself – go in procession to the bride's home.
        Bride's
        friends and family apply turmeric paste to her body as a part of Gaye Hoof bride, and they are traditionally all
        in
        matching clothes, mostly orange. The bride is seated on a dais, and the henna is used to decorate the bride's
        hands and
        feet with elaborate abstract designs. The sweets are then fed to the bride by all involved, piece by piece. The
        actual
        wedding ceremony "Biye" follows the Gaye Holud ceremonies. The wedding ceremony is arranged by the bride's
        family. On
        the day, the younger members of the bride's family barricade the entrance to the venue and demand a sort of
        admission
        charge from the groom in return for allowing him to enter.
      </p>
      <img src="img/culture/mehedi.jpg" alt="mehedi" class="img-fluid rounded py-4">
      <p class="lead">
        The bride and groom are seated separately, and a Kazi (authorized person by the govt. to perform the wedding),
        accompanied by the parents and a Wakil (witness) from each side formally asks the bride for her consent to the
        union,
        and then the groom for his. The bride's side of the family tries to play some kind of practical joke on the
        groom such
        as stealing the groom's shoe. The reception, also known as Bou-Bhaat (reception), is a party given by the
        groom's family
        in return for the wedding party. It is typically a much more relaxed affair, with only the second-best wedding
        outfit
        being worn. This is more or less the Musim wedding procession. The Hindu weddings also follow the same parts of
        the
        wedding but the wedding part is somewhat different. The wedding is done along with a feast and according to the
        Hindu
        religion's wedding steps, e.g. Shat-pake-badha; Shidur Daan etc. the wedding most likely lasts the whole night
        starting
        at the evening. The Christian and Buddhist Wedding follow a totally different Process. They more or less follow
        Western
        Culture and Methods. Sometimes they too follow the Bengali wedding procession.

      <h2>Durga Puja <small>(The Most Big Celebration For Hindu)</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">Durga Puja, the largest religious festival for Hindus, is celebrated widely across Bangladesh.
        Thousands of pandals
        (mandaps) are set up in various villages, towns, and cities. Durga Puja is a grand cultural celebration in the
        capital
        city of Dhaka. Major pujas of Dhaka are held in numerous pandals, but the biggest celebration takes place at
        Dhakeshwari
        Temple where several thousand devotees and onlookers stream through the premises for four days. Special boat
        race on
        Buriganga river is arranged and it attracts a large crowd. A five-day holiday is observed by all educational
        institutions, while Bijoya Dashami is a public holiday. On Bijoya Dashami, effigies are paraded through the
        streets of
        Shankhari Bazaar in Old Dhaka in loud, colorful processions before being immersed into the rivers. Thousands of
        Muslims
        take part in the secular part of festivities in celebration of Bengali solidarity and culture.</p>
      <img src="img/culture/puja.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid py-4 rounded">
      <p class="lead">Durga Puja celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the demon king Mahishasura. It begins
        on the same day as
        Navratri, a nine-night festival celebrating the divine feminine.Durga Puja’s first day is Mahalaya, which
        heralds the advent of the goddess. Celebrations and worship begin on Sasthi,
        the sixth day. During the following three days, the goddess is worshipped in her various forms as Durga,
        Lakshmi, and
        Sarasvati. The celebrations end with Vijaya Dashami (“Tenth Day of Victory” ), when, amid loud chants and
        drumbeats,
        idols are carried in huge processions to local rivers, where they are immersed. That custom is symbolic of the
        departure
        of the deity to her home and to her husband, Shiva, in the Himalayas. Images of the goddess—astride a lion,
        attacking
        the demon king Mahishasura—are placed at various pandals (elaborately decorated bamboo structures and galleries)
        and
        temples.</p>
