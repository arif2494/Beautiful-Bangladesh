      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="lead">Covered in greenery as well as undulating hills. Bangladesh echoes with the Muslim call to prayer
        as well as Buddhist
        chants, and is one of the most mysterious and wonderful lands in Asia. Bangladesh is the neighbor of India, but
        you will
        find a less developed and more laid back atmosphere here.

        The country had a tumultuous past that saw it gain freedom from first the British and then from Pakistani rule.
        When you
        consider that all this happened in the 20th century, it just goes to show what a turbulent recent past
        Bangladesh has
        had to endure. As a result, it offers a slice of authentic life to travelers who want an untainted image of the
        region.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">TThe people of Bangladesh are famously friendly and welcoming and the country is full of cultural
        wonders such as
        the tea
        covered highlands of Srimangal to the gorgeous golden sands of Cox’s Bazar, which is actually the third longest
        beach in
        the world. Other highlights include bustling cities like Dhaka as well as areas of rural paradise like the
        Sundarbans
        National Park.</p>

      <h2>Coxs Bazar <small>(Longest Ses Beach In The World)</small> </h2>


      <p class="lead">Spilling out into the Bay of Bengal is Cox’s Bazar, an area covered in salty fishing skiffs and
        bustling jetties.

        This little town in the far south-east of Bangladesh is known for its stunning beach which stretches for an
        amazing 120
        kilometers from north to south along the side of the balmy Indian Ocean.

        This is the third longest beach on the planet and you will find local fishermen reeling in the day’s catch as
        well as
        bubbling rock pools and crashing turquoise waves that make this a great spot for surfing.
      </p>

      <h2>Sundarbans <small>(Biggest Mangrove Forest)</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The Sundarbans are located at the point where the mighty waterways of the Brahmaputra and the scared Ganges
        crash into
        each other at the edge of the Bay of Bengal.

        As you would expect, the area is also covered in spectacular wildlife and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

        Here you will find Bengal tigers stalking the mangroves as well as rhesus macaques swinging in the canopies.

        Other highlights include chitals and you will also find local huts dotted around the area and hiding beneath
        waxy palm
        trees.
      </p>

      <h2>Saint Martin <small>(Most Beautiful Island)</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The little enclave of Saint Martin is like nowhere else in Bangladesh as this is the only coral island in the
        country.

        The region is covered in shifting sands and lapping seas, all nestled close to coconut groves.

        In many ways it looks more like the Caribbean than South Asia, and you will find delicious seafood here
        including fiery
        curries.

        Scuba diving is also a popular pastime, so if you want to check out some of the country’s amazing aquatic life
        then this
        is the place to do it.
      </p>


      <h2>Srimangal <small>(The Kingdom Of Tea)</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">Srimangal is the tea-growing capital of Bangladesh and the area is a riot of different hues of
        green.

        The area is famous for its rains which help the tea to grow and you will find a sea of different plantations
        here as you
        explore the highlands and the hamlets that make up Srimangal.

        On a trip here make sure to visit a local tea processing plant which will usually include a trip to a tasting
        house so
        that you can enjoy a cup of fragrant tea whilst enjoying the views over the rippling fields.

        Hiking is also poplar in the area although the undulating landscapes mean that some hikes are more challenging
        than
        others.</p>

      <h2>Kuakata <small>(The Daughter Of the Sea)</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Kuakata Beach juts out into the Indian Ocean from the southern side of the river islands of central Bangladesh.

        One of the great reasons to come here is to watch the sunset over the sea with the glowing Sundarbans in the
        distance.

        The beach is fringed with tropical palm trees and you will also find small rivers that cut through the land to
        the Bay
        of Bengal.

        This area of Bangladesh is less visited by tourists so if you are looking for the road less traveled then this
        is a good
        spot to choose.

        Some of the people you will see here are the local fisherman and you can sample delicious curried crab and
        lobster.
      </p>

      <h2>Sajek Valley <small>(The Playground Of The Cloud)</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Who does not want to be lost in a white cloud-like cotton? Sajek Valley, currently the most popular destination
        for
        pilgrims/travelers, is located in the biggest union of Bangladesh, Baghaichari Upazila of Rangamati district. It
        is on
        the border of Mizoram in the north of Rangamati district. The north side of Sajek is Tripura, Langadu of
        Rangamati on
        the south, Mizoram of India on the east, Khigrachori Dighinala on the west. The height of Sajek Valley from sea
        level is
        1800 feet. Though the location of Sajek is in Rangamati district, it is very easy to travel from Dighinala to
        Khagrachari due to geographical reasons. Sajek is 70km away from Khagrachari district and 40 kilometers from
        Dighinalala. If you want to go to Sajek, you will have to get permission from the Baghaihat Police or Army camp.

        Sajek is the biggest union of Bangladesh whose size is 702 square miles. The area is formed with the combination
        of
        Sajek Ruiluipara and Konglak Para. Established in 1885, the height of the Ruiluipara is approximately 1720 feet
        from the
        sea level and the height of the Konglakpara from the sea level is approximately 1800 feet. Mainly, Sajek is the
        living
        place of indigenous people including Lusai, Pankhwa, and Tripura. The banana and orange of Sajek are very
        famous. Many
        parts of Rangamati are seen from Sajek Valley. So the Sajek valley is called the roof of Rangamati.
