      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="lead">Bangladeshi cuisine has over time been largely influenced by the Mughlai cuisine left behind by
        the Persian Rulers. This
        has led Bangladeshi cuisine to include many rich aromatic dishes such as biriyani and korma that requires the
        use of a
        large array of spices along with an extensive amount of ghee. Dhaka being the Mughal capital of the Bengal Subah
        (which
        includes the modern Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal) was a major trading center in South Asia,
        so many
        culinary styles from around the world influenced the city's cuisine. After Dhaka became the capital of East
        Bengal, the
        Bangladeshi populace began to adopt the cuisine of the city with many unknown Persian, Turkish and
        Arabic-influenced
        dishes becoming popular.
