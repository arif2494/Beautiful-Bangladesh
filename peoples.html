      <p class="lead"><strong>Bengalis</strong> or Bangalees/Bangalis (Bengali: বাঙালি [baŋali]), also rendered as the
        Bengali people,[28] are an Indo-Aryan
        ethnolinguistic group native to the Bengal region in South Asia. The population is divided between the region of
        Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam's Barak Valley. Most of them speak Bengali, a
        language from the Indo-Aryan language family. The term "Bangalee" is also used to denote people of Bangladesh as
        a
        nation.[29]

        Bengalis are the third-largest ethnic group in the world, after Han Chinese and Arabs.[30] Apart from Bangladesh
        and the
        Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, and Assam's Barak Valley, Bengali-majority populations also reside in
        India's
        union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands as well as Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts, with significant
        populations in Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and
        Uttarakhand.[31] The
        global Bengali diaspora (Bangladeshi diaspora and Indian Bengalis) have well-established communities in
        Pakistan, the
        United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Middle East, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore,
        and
        Italy.

        They have four major religious subgroups: Bengali Muslims, Bengali Hindus, Bengali Christians, and Bengali
        Buddhists.

      <p class="lead">Bengal renaissance refers to a socio-religious reform movement during the nineteenth and early
        twentieth centuries,
        centered around the city of Calcutta and predominantly led by upper caste Bengali Hindus under the patronage of
        the
        British Raj who created a reformed religion called Brahmo dharma. Historian Nitish Sengupta describes the Bengal
        renaissance as having started with reformer and humanitarian Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1775–1833), considered the
        "Father of
        the Bengal renaissance", and ended with Asia's first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941).

        Other figures have been considered to be part of the renaissance. Swami Vivekananda is considered a key figure
        in the
        introduction of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and
        bringing Hinduism to the status of a world religion during the 1800s. Jagadish Chandra Bose was a Bengali
        polymath:
        a physicist, biologist, botanist, archaeologist, and writer of science fiction who pioneered the investigation
        of
        radio and microwave optics, made significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of
        experimental
        science in the Indian subcontinent. He is considered one of the fathers of radio science, and is also considered
        the father of Bengali science fiction. Satyendra Nath Bose was a Bengali physicist, specialising in mathematical
        physics. He is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, providing the foundation for
        Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of the Bose–Einstein condensate. He is honoured as the namesake of the
        boson.

        According to Nitish Sengupta, though the Bengal renaissance was the "culmination of the process of emergence of
        the
        cultural characteristics of the Bengali people that had started in the age of Hussein Shah, it remained
        predominantly
        Hindu and only partially Muslim." There were, nevertheless, examples of Muslim intellectuals such as Syed Ameer
        Ali,
        Mosharraf Hussain, Sake Dean Mahomed, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Roquia Sakhawat Hussain. The Freedom of Intellect
        Movement sought to challenge religious and social dogma in Bengali Muslim society.

        The earliest extant work in Bengali literature is the Charyapada, a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating
        back to
        the 10th and 11th centuries. Thereafter, the timeline of Bengali literature is divided into two periods:
        medieval
        (1360–1800) and modern (1800–present). Bengali literature is one of the most enriched bodies of literature in
        Modern
        India and Bangladesh.

        The first works in Bengali, written in new Bengali, appeared between 10th and 12th centuries CE It is generally
        known as
        the Charyapada. These are mystic songs composed by various Buddhist seer-poets: Luipada, Kanhapada, Kukkuripada,
        Chatilpada, Bhusukupada, Kamlipada, Dhendhanpada, Shantipada, Shabarapada, etc. The famous Bengali linguist
        Haraprasad
        Shastri discovered the palm-leaf Charyapada manuscript in the Nepal Royal Court Library in 1907.

        The Middle Bengali Literature is a period in the history of Bengali literature dating from 15th to 18th
        centuries.
        Following the Mughal invasion of Bengal in the 13th century, literature in vernacular Bengali began to take
        shape. The
        oldest example of Middle Bengali literature is believed to be Shreekrishna Kirtana by Boru Chandidas. In the
        mid-19th
        century, Bengali literature gained momentum. During this period, the Bengali Pandits of Fort William College did
        the
        tedious work of translating textbooks in Bengali to help teach the British local languages including Bengali.
        This work
        played a role in the background in the evolution of Bengali prose.
